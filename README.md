# Rainbow-role-discord
Change role color every X seconds

This is a rewrite of the rainbow bot by the amazing [DeadBread](https://github.com/DeadBread76)

Don't put the delay under 5 or you will get limited (delay is in second btw)

a good config should look like this

```
token = 'NTg5OTY5ODcyMDc4MzExNDM2.XQbZiQ.SYXezQZCKh-qYE5cCyJr758YWZ9'
serverid = 548887219172278292
rainbowrolename = "Rainbow role"
delay = 5
```
